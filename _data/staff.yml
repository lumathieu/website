  description: "His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics.
  Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning.
  Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation.

  description: "I am leading the [3D GeoInformation](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) group, Section Urban Data Science at the Department of [Urbanism](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/urbanism/).
  I obtained my PhD degree ([3D Cadastre](http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2004/phd/stoter.pdf)) in 2004.
  For this work I received the Tienstra award.
  After my PhD I worked several years at ITC, University of Twente (2004-2009) and led there a research group on “automated generalisation”.
  I combine my professorship with a job as innovation consultant at the [Kadaster](http://www.kadaster.nl/web/english.htm). From TU Delft I am posted to [Geonovum](http://www.geonovum.nl).
  In December 2016, I became a Principal Investigator at the [Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](http://www.ams-amsterdam.com)

  My research interests are 3D, automated generalization and information modelling.
  For my research on [5D data modelling](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geo5d/) I received the Vidi grant of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation ([NWO](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2010)).
  In addition I received a Starting Grant from the European Research Council for my proposal Urban Modelling in higher dimensions ([ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_stg_results_all_domains.pdf)).
  I am (co)author of over 350 academic and professional articles.
  I am fulfilling/have fulfilled several roles in the Open Geospatial Consortium and the European Spatial Data Research association.
  I am a member of the editorial boards of several journals: [CEUS](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems/), the [Geography Journal](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/geography/) and the [International Journal of 3D Information Modelling](http://www.irma-international.org/journal/international-journal-information-modeling-ij3dim/41967/)"

  description: "I am Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow under the supervision of [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) and [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/). 
  My research focuses on physically-based modelling of interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment.\\
  
  Before joining TU Delft, I was research engineer at the [Masdar Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.ku.ac.ae/institute/masdar-institute) in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates).
  Then, I was full-time Ph.D student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) where I was granted the [President's Graduate Fellowship](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/prospective-students/graduate/research/scholarships/presidents-graduate-fellowship).
  After receiving my Ph.D., I worked as postdoctoral research scholar at the [Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore](https://bears.berkeley.edu/) under the SinBerBEST 2 Theme D project.\\

  The Marie Curie action is a three-year project called Smart City Innovations and Experiments using New Climate and Energy Simulations (SCIENCES) and supervised by [Prof. Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/), [Assist. Prof. Clara Garcia-Sanchez](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/gsclara), and [Prof. Mario Berges](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/people/faculty/berges.html). 
  In this project, I am looking for solutions to (1) improve simulations of air pollutants in urban areas, (2) co-simulate statistical and physically-based urban microclimate models, and (3) generate physically-based models from 3D city models and Internet-of-Things.
  Based on these solutions, it is aimed at proving that physically-based urban microclimate models could easily be integrated into digital twin platforms for the development of climate-neutral and smart cities."
