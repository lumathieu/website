  description: "His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics.
  Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning.
  Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation.
  He is currently chair of the [ISPRS Technical Commission 4 WG 10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html) and national representative for Austria of the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS)."

  description: "I am a full professor in Spatial Data Infrastructure, at the Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment and I am leading the [3D GeoInformation](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) group at the Department of [Urbanism](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/urbanism/).
  I obtained my PhD degree ([3D Cadastre](http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2004/phd/stoter.pdf)) in 2004.
  For this work I received the Tienstra award.
  After my PhD I worked several years at ITC, University of Twente (2004-2009) and led there a research group on “automated generalisation”.
  I combine my professorship with jobs as researcher at both the [Kadaster](http://www.kadaster.nl/web/english.htm) and [Geonovum](http://www.geonovum.nl).
  I am chair of the [EuroSDR](www.eurosdr.net) 3D Special Interest Group [EuroSDR 3D SIG](http://www.eurosdr.net/research/project/eurosdr-special-interest-group-3d-3d-sig).
  Since March 2015, I am vice-chair of the Open Geospatial COnsortium 3D Information Management Domain Working Group [(OGC 3DIM DWG)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg).
  In December 2016, I became a Principal Investigator at the [Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](http://www.ams-amsterdam.com)

  My research interests are 3D, automated generalization and information modelling.
  For my research on [5D data modelling](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geo5d/) I received the prestigious Vidi award of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation ([NWO](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2010)).
  In addition I received a Starting Grant from the European Research Council for my proposal Urban Modelling in higher dimensions ([ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_stg_results_all_domains.pdf)).
  I am (co)author of over 350 academic and professional articles and appeared several times in regional and national media.
  I am a member of the editorial boards of several journals: [CEUS](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems/), the [Geography Journal](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/geography/) and the [International Journal of 3D Information Modelling](http://www.irma-international.org/journal/international-journal-information-modeling-ij3dim/41967/)"
