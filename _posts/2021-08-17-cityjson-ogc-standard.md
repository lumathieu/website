We're happy to announce that one project of our group, [CityJSON](https://cityjson.org), is now an OGC community standard!

[<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> document 20-072r2](https://docs.ogc.org/cs/20-072r2/20-072r2.html)

We'd like to thank all the contributors so far (to the specifications and to the several software package supporting it), and to the organisations who supported CityJSON and helped us getting it approved as an OGC standard: Geonovum, Kadaster International, virtualcitySYSTEMS, National University of Singapore, Forum Virium Helsinki Oy, and Ordnance Survey.

En route towards the upcoming version 1.1!
