Nadine Hobeika and Maarten Pronk have just joined our research group as PhD students, and Zhaiyu Chen as a researcher.

After finishing her Architecture Master in Lebanon, Nadine gained her MSc in Geomatics at TU Delft. Her MSc thesis studied wind flow around beach houses to promote the formation of coastal dunes. Nadine's PhD topic focuses on developing a CFD-based tool to assess ventilation design strategies in a fast pace.

Maarten is focusing on generating an accurate global terrain model using sparse spaceborne LiDAR, and Zhaiyu will work on optimal integration of AHN 3/4 with application in 3D building modelling.

Welcome Nadine, Maarten, and Zhaiyu, and good luck!
