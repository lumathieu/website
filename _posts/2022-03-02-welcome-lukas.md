Lukas Beuster has joined our research group as a researcher.

He studied Geography at Hamburg University in Germany and gained his MPhil in Urban and Regional Science at the Centre for Urban and Regional Innovation and Statistical Exploration (CRUISE) at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. For his Masters' thesis, he studied the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon in Cape Town, mapping the intensity and extent as well as the local, regional, and international policy frameworks dealing with UHI mitigation. 

After finishing his Masters, Lukas left academia and spent a few years in the non-profit sector and was a founding member of [HereWeGrow](https://www.herewegrow.org/en), working on empowering smallholder coffee farmers and increasing their incomes. 

His true passion, however, lies within urban development, where he aims to make an impact by providing the best possible data for decision-making and advocating for the use of (GIS-)technology.

Within the research group, Lukas will focus on operationalizing digital twin technologies by identifying characteristics of urban areas that impact environmental phenomena such as UHI, wind and pollution. 


Welcome, Lukas!
