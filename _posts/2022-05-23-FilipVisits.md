Last Friday, [Filip Biljecki](https://filipbiljecki.com/) visited the group as an alumnus to give a presentation about his current work at [NUS Urban Analytics Lab](https://ual.sg/). 
He finished his [PhD](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f12931b7-5113-47ef-bfd4-688aae3be248) within our group and he is now an assistant professor at NUS.

Several of our other alumni joined as well both on campus and online.
It was great to catch up with previous colleagues and meet the new members of the group.
It was a lovely Friday afternoon and it wouldn't be a Dutch event if you don't get soaked from the rain at some point!

Thank you to everyone who was able to make it and, for those who couldn't make it, we hope to see you next time!
