Once again, we had a wonderful time hosting some [VOLTA](https://volta.fbk.eu/) visitors for their secondments during May. As always, it was a nice learning experience for all of us!

We had Elena Valari and Nikos Lithoxopoulos from [GeoImaging Ltd](https://geoimaging.com.cy/), Cyprus.

Both experimented with using our software to reconstruct 3D models from their data. Elena applied a [deep learning framework](https://github.com/tudelft3d/SUMS-Semantic-Urban-Mesh-Segmentation-public/tree/main/competing_methods/my_KPConv) for semantic segmentation of urban point clouds. She then utilised the semantically labelled point clouds as input data to reconstruct the LoD1 city models using [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier). Nikos used [Polyfit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit) to test the 3D model reconstruction of the antenna point clouds and investigated the business opportunities in 3D city models.

Elena and Nikos both evaluated our performance in sports, by joining our squash and volleyball sessions. ðŸ˜Š

We hope to see you soon! ðŸ™Œ
