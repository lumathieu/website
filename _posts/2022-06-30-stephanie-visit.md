Another research visit in our group? You betcha!

[Stéphanie Zeoli](https://staff.umons.ac.be/stephanie.zeoli/index.html), from [University of Mons (UMONS)](https://web.umons.ac.be/en/) is visiting us on campus in June and July and we are excited to have her around!

Stéphanie obtained a Ph.D in Engineering sciences and Technology in 2018 at UMONS and she is a research and teaching associate at the fluids-machines unit since then. She works on numerical simulations of atmospheric flows with applications to wind engineering problems. She specifically focuses on wind energy and air quality topics. Her objective is to contribute to the development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques that will lead to better flow predictions.
