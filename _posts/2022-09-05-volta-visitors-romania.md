We had a wonderful time hosting [VOLTA](https://volta.fbk.eu/) visitors for their secondments during August. As always, it was a nice learning experience for all of us!

We had Iuliana Cuibac and Nicoleta Parvulescu from the [National Centre of Cartography of Romania](https://www.cngcft.ro/index.php/en/).

Both experimented with using our software to reconstruct 3D models from their data. Iuliana investigated how to find and reduce artifacts in DTM generation from images and tried out our [AdTree software](https://github.com/tudelft3d/AdTree) for 3D tree reconstruction from LiDAR data. And Nicoleta gained experience using the [Geoflow software](https://github.com/geoflow3d/geoflow-bundle) for LoD2 building reconstruction.

We also learned a lot from their presentation on their daily work at the National Centre of Cartography in Bucharest.

It was a pleasure hosting you both!
