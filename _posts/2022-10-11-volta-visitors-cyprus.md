Once again, we enjoyed hosting [VOLTA](https://volta.fbk.eu/) visitors for their secondments during September. As always, it was a great learning experience for all of us!

We had Elena Valari and Eleni Fotiadou from GeoImaging Ltd, Cyprus. It was Elena's second time visiting us.

During their stay, Elena continued to work on the semantic segmentation of urban point clouds by using state-of-the-art deep learning networks. She applied the pre-trained models to the dataset acquired in Cyprus and achieved promising results, especially in building classification. Eleni focused on the 3D reconstruction of urban objects using our software. For reconstructing buildings, she used [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier); for reconstructing antenna, she used [AdTree](https://github.com/tudelft3d/AdTree).

It was a pleasure hosting you both!
