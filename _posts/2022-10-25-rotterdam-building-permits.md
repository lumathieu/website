The City of Rotterdam has [won the DigiDare 2022 award](https://www.bimloket.nl/p/1167/Vergunningscontroleservice-wint-DigiDare-Award-2022) for their building permit check service, which builds on [a research project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/rotterdamgeobim_bp/) and [software prototype](https://github.com/twut/GEOBIM_Tool) that our group started with the city of Rotterdam in 2019. The award-winning building check service was developed by the city of Rotterdam in collaboration with the software companies Braindex, Building Bits and RDF.  We are happy that the potentials of digital building permitting are now firmly acknowledged and that software vendors are now pushing research ideas into practice. We are looking forward to further development of this building permit process in our EU funded project [CHEK](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/chek/) with both Rotterdam and RDF, who is one of  partners in this new project.
