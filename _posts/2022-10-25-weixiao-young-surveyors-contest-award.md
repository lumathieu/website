The [CLGE Young Surveyors' Contest](https://www.clge.eu/2022/clge/clge-young-surveyors-contest-2022-winners-announced-at-intergeo) took place on Oct. 19th at INTERGEO in Essen (DE). The Chair of the CLGE Vetting Committee opened the well-attended Awarding Ceremony and announced that [Weixiao Gao](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/weixiao/), a Ph.D. candidate of our group, has won the second prize (â‚¬1,000) in the Ph.D. category of the contest for his excellent research paper [SUM: A benchmark datasets of Semantic Urban Meshes](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/meshannotation/). His paper presents the first large-scale benchmark dataset of semantic urban meshes, a semi-automatic mesh annotation framework, and a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.
This research has also inspired follow-ups and interesting applications in 3D Geoinformation and computer vision. Many thanks also to the funders of this research, including [Cyclomedia](https://www.cyclomedia.com/) and [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/).
