On the 17th of November, we hosted an event to promote the use of [3DBAG](3dbag.nl) in the Building Information Modelling (BIM) field with the Dutch [GeoBIM experts](https://www.geobimexperts.nl/). We presented our work on the [3DBAG](3dbag.nl) with [3DGI](3dgi.nl) and our on-going research on the [CHEK project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/chek/, which includes developing [Autodesk Revit](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cityjsonToRevit) and [Rhino](https://github.com/cityjson/RhinoCityJSON) plugins for exporting Geo to BIM environment ). They also presented 4 use cases for [3DBAG](3dbag.nl) in the BIM world.

It was a pleasure to host this event and we look forward to future collaborations!
