Daniele Cannatella has recently joined our research group as an assistant professor, and Daan van der Heide as a PhD candidate.

Daniele's research focus is on how to steer and boost sustainable urban and landscape development in the light of climate change, using, generating and modeling data on the built environment and Open Science.

Welcome Daniele and Daan, and good luck!
