We are glad to announce the release of [CityJSON Importer](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7787623024858844510&appLang=en&os=Win64), a new plugin now available for [Autodesk速 Revit速](https://www.autodesk.eu/products/revit/overview) users. This software tool represents a step forward in tackling the georeferencing problem faced by architects, engineers, and other professionals working with geospatial data in BIM environment.


Utilizing the coordinate referencing system (CRS) and metadata present within the CityJSON file, CityJSON Importer reprojects and translates incoming data, enabling a seamless integration process. With the CityJSON Importer, users can now import and work with CityJSON data directly within Autodesk速 Revit速, eliminating the need for manual data conversion and translation.


The plugin can be downloaded free of charge at the [Autodesk App Store](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7787623024858844510&appLang=en&os=Win64), and its [source code](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cityjsonToRevit) is openly available for users who wish to access it.
