Akshay has joined our group as a post-doctoral researcher.

He studied Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Pune in India to obtain his B.E. He then moved to the Delft University of Technology (TUD) at the CiTG faculty to study Environmental Fluid Mechanics, where he worked mainly on developing and applying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for tsunami interactions with sea walls and wave overtopping predictions in shallow coastal environments. While at TUD, he briefly visited the University of Western Australia as part of his MSc. thesis research. 

Inspired by the viability of CFD in environmental flows, he then moved to Stanford University in the United States to study the interaction of surface gravity waves, turbulence, and tidal currents over naturally rough walls. Here he developed a highly efficient parallel code to enable direct simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations for such complex flow environments to better understand the turbulence physics. 

Akshay is passionate about  environmental flows, turbulence physics, and CFD. Outside his scientific interests, he enjoys music and travelling.  

Within the group, he will focus on applying CFD techniques to study flows within urban environments and quantify the uncertainties in these predictions.

Welcome, Akshay!
