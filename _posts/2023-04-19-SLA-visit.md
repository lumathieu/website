On April 18th, we had the pleasure of hosting a visit from  [Singapore Land Authority](https://www.sla.gov.sg) at our group in Delft. During the visit, we presented our research on 3D modeling solutions for cities, buildings, and landscapes, which we have been designing, developing, and implementing to support environmental modeling, urban planning, and design.

Our team had the opportunity to showcase our latest findings on data acquisition, modeling/reconstruction, data maintenance, and the use of 3D data in urban applications. We were thrilled to share our work with the Singapore delegation and believe that our solutions can help them achieve their goals for sustainable development and urban planning. We look forward to exploring potential collaborations in the future.

Overall, the visit was an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas and knowledge with the delegation. We are committed to continuing our research to contribute to the development of smarter and more sustainable cities worldwide.
