In the 3D GeoInformation Group we are committed to making our workplace diverse, equitable, and inclusive. On January 12, we had our latest DEI event: the Speed-Survey Card Game. The game was designed to follow a speed-dating format but was aimed at asking piercing questions on the various aspects of DEI. The idea was to create a comfortable and open space for participants to explore and discuss complex topics in a straightforward and impactful manner.

Over the past year, our DEI task force has organised many such events. Previous initiatives include a debate designed to hone our skills in constructive disagreement and a screening of the documentary ‘Picture a Scientist’, which was followed by an open discussion on gender issues in academia. It’s all about keeping the conversation on DEI going and growing!
