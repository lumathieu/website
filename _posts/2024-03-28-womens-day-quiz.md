In alignment with our dedication to diversity & inclusion, we recently hosted a belated celebration of International Women's Day. The event featured a hand-crafted quiz by the women of our group featuring questions not only about prominent women scientists but also about themselves. Our male colleagues enthusiastically participated in the event and you can tell by the happy faces of our winners!
