Last Tuesday, the Urbanism department lunch took on a unique twist. Attendees, while enjoying their lunch, were invited to partake in our engaging Speed-Survey card game.

Much like the previous occasion when the [IDEA taskforce]({{ site.baseurl }}/idea) hosted this event only for the 3D GeoInformation group, participants were encouraged to mingle and conduct a brief survey on a significant topic from one of four categories: hierarchy, gender bias, safety, and inclusion. Given the larger turnout this time, attendees were grouped into teams of three and they collectively gathered their data and presented it.

We are delighted to report that, at least in terms of socializing and enthusiasm the event was successful! Here are some photos to prove it:
