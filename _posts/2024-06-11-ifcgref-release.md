We are happy to announce the launch of [IfcGref](https://ifcgref.bk.tudelft.nl), now with a new interface and a host of enhanced features! 
Here are the key enhancements in this release:

- **New 3D Visualization:** Improved 3D visualization capabilities for georeferenced BIM models.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** A redesigned UI that is more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Comprehensive User Guide:** Detailed documentation to assist users in navigating and using the tool efficiently.
- **Performance Improvements:** Faster processing speeds for a more efficient workflow.

 [IfcGref](https://ifcgref.bk.tudelft.nl) is designed to support  engineers, architects, and developers in converting the local coordinate reference system (CRS) of BIM models to the projected CRS of city models. By utilizing geo-information from BIM models and user inputs, IfcGref computes georeferencing attributes, updates IFC models, and visually represents 3D BIM models on a city map.
