## Add support for CityJSON in BlueSky

![](img/bluesky.jpg){:width="400px"}

[BlueSky](https://github.com/TUDelft-CNS-ATM/bluesky) is an open Air Traffic Simulator that is being actively used to perform research on Air Traffic Management and Air Traffic Flows. It would be extremely beneficial for such simulations to take advantage of 3D city models by adding support for [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org/) loading.

In this project you'll have to implement parsing of CityJSON for the needs of BlueSky. The tool is open source and is written in Python. There will be support from the developers of the tool in the process.

You'll improve your programming skills in the process and learn a lot about manipulating 3D geometry.
