## Vacancy Assistant Professor Urban Data for Design


Urban data and digitalisation are essential instruments to face the complexity of contemporary interdisciplinary sustainable urbanisation challenges, such as the energy transition, the transition towards a circular built environment, and the transformation towards just, resilient, inclusive, and healthy cities. 
We are looking for an Assistant Professor whose research and teaching will focus on how FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) urban, geo-based data and Open Science can steer and guide sustainable urbanisation, as part of studies on urban change processes.  
The position will bridge the domains of geo data science on the one hand and urban and landscape design on the other hand.

### RESEARCH
The research challenges of this position focus on how to steer and guide sustainable urban and landscape design using FAIR data about the built environment and Open Science. 
How can open data/science approaches be integrated in studies on urban change processes in order to steer responsible and suatainable urbanisation? What are the technical, conceptual, and methodological challenges and opportunities?
How will open data and digitalisation influence the design and planning of landscapes and urban areas?

### EDUCATION
The challenge for education is firstly to teach open data/science approaches in urban and landscape design studies: 
How to work with open data and tools to design buildings, landscapes and urban areas (BIM/GIS and design tools; urban and building simulation tools)?
Secondly, our students need to gain data literacy to understand how FAIR data and digital technologies can guide the design of sustainable urban areas.
This will help them to use open data about the built environment to their full potential in urban/landscape design and related planning and decision-making processes, and at the same time have a responsible and critical standpoint.

The educational tasks of the position are more particularly:
- to integrate the use of FAIR urban, geo-based data into design education within the BSc Architecture ('Bouwkunde') and the MSc tracks Urbanism and Landscape Architecture
- to help our students to develop technical skills: how to find, prepare and use FAIR data about the built environment for sustainable urban/landscape design? How to perform data analysis and simulations to study the impact of urban and landscape designs on e.g. accessibility, spatial integration, noise, water/flooding, wind comfort, daylight/shadow, energy.
- to help students gain understanding of the opportunities and challenges of open urban data and digitalisation in studies on sustainable urbanisation.

### We are looking for an Assistant Professor 
....with a relevant background to tackle these urban data challenges in our design research and education. 
The specific focus area of the position will be further detailed by the selected candidate in collaboration with the resarch and teaching staff in the Section, Department and Faculty.


## Research group

The position will be embedded in the [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Section Urban Data Science part of the [Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment](http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en).
The Section focuses on governance and technologies underpinning open geo-data and the integration with Building Information Models and aims at designing, developing, and implementing open data and open source solutions to model cities, buildings, and landscapes in 3D for environmental and urban studies. Open Science is an important principle of our research.
The section UDS is also the main provider of education in the MSc Geomatics, hosted in the same Faculty. 
It is a multidisciplinary group of about [20 people](/about/), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers.
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), standards and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.


## Job requirements
The candidate has:
- a PhD degree in a topic related to (open) urban/GIS data and using these data in urban/regional/environmental/landscape design or spatial planning
- proven expert level GIS knowledge and experience (data and software)
- scientific skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications or by other work/achievements
- affinity with education and multidisciplinary teaching, preferable holding a University Teaching Qualification certificate (or the ambition to acquire this within a short period of time)
- the ambition to see educational innovation as part of her/his career plan
- communication, networking, and collaboration skills
- experience in supervision of MSc students
