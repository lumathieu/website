## Digitalisation of Building Permit Checks by GeoBIM approaches

In the recently awarded Horizon Europe project CHEK (CHANGE TOOLKIT FOR DIGITAL BUILDING PERMIT (DBP)) 19 partners across Europe will develop an innovative kit of both methodological and technical tools to digitise building permitting and automated compliance checks for new building designs as well as for renovations in European urban areas. The CHEK consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team covering GIS, BIM, municipal processes and planning, data integration and standardisation and is a multisectoral mix of research & education, AEC- and software-companies, governmental institutions, and international standardisation organisations (OGC and BuildingSmart).
To perform our tasks in this project, [3D Geoinformation research group, Section Urban Data Science](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) has two open positions that build on our previous GeoBIM work and on our DBP related activities.
Apart from coordination and dissemination of the project results, our research group is responsible for the development of:
•	validators for BIM and 3D GIS data.
•	a georeferencer for BIM data.
•	a BIM to Geo converter.
•	a technical-scientific course on digital building permit checking.
We are also involved in the following tasks:
•	Interpretation and formalisation of regulations and encoding them into a machine-readable format.
•	Definition of the level of information needed for rule checking and model preparation.
•	Representation of required design information according to open BIM and open geospatial standards.
•	Development of a Geo to BIM converter.
To support these tasks, we are looking for two candidates who can be either a first stage or a recognised researcher, or a scientific developer.

## Research group
The positions are embedded in the [3D Geoinformation research group, Section Urban Data Science](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), part of the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl)
The group focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes. It is a multidisciplinary group of around 20 people(/about/),, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 5 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 3 assistant-professor). It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open source software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), [standards](https://www.cityjson.org), [3D open data](https://3dbag.nl/en/viewer) and patents for the management of 3D geographic information and Building Information Models.

## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char -->
