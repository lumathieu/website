## Digitalisation of Building Permit Checks by GeoBIM approaches

In the Horizon Europe project CHEK ([CHANGE TOOLKIT FOR DIGITAL BUILDING PERMIT](https://chekdbp.eu/)), that started 1st of October 2022, 19 partners across Europe are developing methodological and technical tools to digitise building permitting and automated compliance checks based on the integration between BIM and GIS. The CHEK consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team covering GIS, BIM, municipal processes and planning, data integration and standardisation (OGC and BuildingSmart).

Apart from coordination, the TU Delft research group is responsible for the development of:
- validator for 3D GIS data
- a georeferencer for BIM data
- a BIM to Geo converter

We are also involved in the following tasks:
- Formalisation of regulations and encoding them into a machine-readable format
- Definition of the level of information needed for rule checking and model preparation
- Representation of data according to open BIM and open geospatial standards
- Development of a Geo to BIM converter

To support the current TU Delft CHEK [research team](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/chek/) we have a two-years open junior or senior (postdoc) research position in our [3D Geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/), Section Urban Data Science, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.
Depending on the profile of the candidate, the candidate will contribute to one or several of the above tasks.


## Research group
The [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around 25 people, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 6 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 4 assistant-professors). 
The group has a history of successful collaborations with industry and government in the past: its research has led to open source software, standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information and Building Information Models.

## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 

Applicants should hold an MSc (for junior researcher) or PhD degree (for senior/postdoc researcher) in building information modelling, geoinformatics/geomatics, computer science, applied mathematics, civil engineering, architecture, or in a related discipline. Programming skills can be beneficial to contribute to some of the tasks.
Applicants are expected to have a good command of English (oral and written) and experience in 3D modelling, BIM and/or computational geometry. 
The candidate should also have an affinity with working in multi‚Äêdisciplinary teams in an international oriented environment.
