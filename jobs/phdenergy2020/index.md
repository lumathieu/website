## 3D city models for energy applications

Thanks to the steady improvements of 3D data acquisition, processing and integration techniques, semantic 3D city models are becoming increasingly available for a wide range of urban applications, ranging from flood simulation to noise assessment. 
However, the potential of semantic 3D city models for energy-related applications has only been partially explored. 
Among the main challenges are: 

  1. the integration of highly heterogeneous data, in terms of semantics, spatial (building-block-neighbourhood-city) and temporal (minute-hour-month-year) resolution; 
  2. the identification of which features/properties from 3D city models contribute the most to improving energy simulations.

The task of this PhD is to investigate how semantic 3D city models can effectively contribute to enhancing multi-scale, energy-related applications. Within this task the PhD will define methodologies and develop algorithms that, for example:

  - Allow a deeper, quantitative insight in the suitability of urban surfaces for installation of solar panels,
  - Advance bottom-up quantitative characterisation of the building stock in terms of energy performance and retrofit potential (e.g. can we fill possible gaps in the input data using machine learning?),
  - Automatically extract from 3D city models suitable data for microclimate simulation tools (e.g. for the  identification of urban heat islands).

The precise field of the study will be discussed and agreed upon between the PhD candidate and the supervisors.
Cooperation with energy experts from TU Delft or other universities and equivalent research centres is envisioned as part of the job, as is the collaboration with practitioners from governmental institutions and municipalities.

The PhD will take place in the [3D geoinformation group at TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) under the supervision of [Dr Giorgio Agugiaro](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/gagugiaro/) and [Prof Jantien Stoter](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter). 
Possibility to spend time as a visiting researcher in other peer institutes (either in the Netherlands or abroad) is also included.


## Research group

The [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), part of the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around [20 people](/about/), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 5 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 3 assistant-professor).
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [open source](https://github.com/tudelft3d) [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.


## Job requirements
<!-- 600 char --> 

We are looking for highly motivated candidates who hold an MSc degree (or almost completed) in computer science, geoinformatics/geomatics, engineering, or in a related discipline. 

They are expected to have a strong interest in 3D city models and energy-related topics, for example, urban energy modelling and simulation. 

They are also expected to have good programming skills and a good command of English (oral and written). The interest and ability to interact with experts from different disciplines will be fundamental to carry out the PhD. 

The starting date is in consultation with the candidate.
