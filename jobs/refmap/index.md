We are looking for a researcher (Postdoc) to explore a multi-fidelity framework in CFD simulations that exploits the accuracy of LES and the efficiency (plus geometrical complexity) of RANS. 

## Multi-fidelity uncertainty quanftication for urban flows: from simple to realistic geometries

The last decades there has been a growing interest in urban flows, linked to an increase attraction to the exploitation of the urban air space. Some contributions have focused on evaluating the impact of urban layouts on airflows, specifically looking at wind, heat and pollution dispersion. In this position, the researcher will explore multi-fidelity techniques (that combine low and high-fidelity CFD simulations) to improve numerical predictions in urban environments, specifically addressing uncertainties related to turbulence modeling, geometry simplification and changing inflow conditions.

The 3D Geoinformation research group, Section Urban Data Science has an open 2.5/3-year position for a researcher (Postdoc) to specifically address the project tasks:

- To complete a large set of evaluations with RANS considering progressively from idealised geometries to complex realistic building layouts with a second-order level of detail. The simulations will be run embedded in an uncertainty framework that allows us to account and prepare for changing meteorological conditions.
- To couple low- and high-fidelity CFD approaches with a multi-fidelity approach using the open-source library Dakota. With this approach, high-fidelity methods based on LES can be combined with the fast-pace and geometrically detailed RANS simulations to retrieve surface responses. Our uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework will take into account stratification, wind gusts and orientation of the incoming flow as uncertain parameters, and we will obtain associated error bars in our flow predictions.

 
## Research group

The position will be embedded in the [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), Section Urban Data Science part of the [Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment).
The group focuses on technologies underpinning open geo-data and the integration with Building Information. Models and aims at designing, developing, and implementing open data and open source solutions to model cities, buildings, and landscapes in 3D for environmental and urban studies.
Open Science is an important principle of our research.
We are also the main provider of education in the [MSc Geomatics](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl).
It is a multidisciplinary group of about [25 people](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/about/#people), including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers.
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d), standards and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.

The researcher will work in close collaboration with the framework under the REFMAP consortium, which aims at developing a digital service that quantifies the environmental footprints of air mobility for airliners and UAS at a "multi-scale" level.

## Job requirements
- Hold a PhD degree in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, geoinformatics/geomatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or in a related engineering discipline.
- Have experience in computational fluid dynamics, machine learning, 3D modelling, preferably from a programming perspective.
- Have good software development skills. Experience with C++ is beneficial.
- Have a good command of English (oral and written).
- Have an affinity with working in multi‐disciplinary teams in an international oriented environment.

## What we offer
- Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The salary is min. €2.960,- to max. € 5.439,- gross per month (salary scale 10 or 11; depending on the experience and education level of the candidate). Besides the salary you also receive an annual holiday payment of 8% and an end of year bonus payment of 8.3%. 
- The position has a fixed-term contract of 2.5-3 years.
- The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, a discount on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.
- For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation. An International Children's Centre offers childcare and there is an international primary school.
