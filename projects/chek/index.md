## Summary

Building permits are mainly issued today through a manual, document-based process. This results in low accuracy, low transparency, and low efficiency. This leads to delays and errors in planning, design and construction. In order to accelerate the digitalization of building permit procedures, several initiatives have been developed. However, none of these have led to a complete transition to digital building permit processes in municipalities.

CHEK is a project that aims to remove barriers to municipalities adopting digital building permit processes through the development, connection, and alignment of scalable solutions that address regulatory and policy contexts, ensure open standards and interoperability (geospatial and BIM), eliminate knowledge gaps through education, improve municipal processes, and implement technology.

In order to accomplish this, CHEK will provide both methodological and technical tools for digitalizing building permits and automating compliance checks on building designs and renovations across Europe. Having modular and standard solutions will enable replicability in different countries and contexts.

## Objectives

CHEK will enable the development and uptake of digital methods and tools for building permits, based on mature and integrated city and building digital data. Urbanistic and building regulations will be addressed, including objective parameters (e.g. max. height, setbacks) plus shadows and qualitative criteria gaining support from (objective) 3D city models analysis (i.e. “the CHEK regulations”).  They cover 70% of the permits4 and represent the major bottlenecks of the process. New constructions and building renovations will be taken into account.

The toolkit of methods and technology provided by CHEK will support municipalities in the transformation towards DBP. The toolkit will consist of (1) a digitally-enabled building permitting process (2) standardised interoperable solutions for data exchange, processing and analysis; (3) training; (4) adapted technology. These will be ready to scale up for application across Europe (5).
