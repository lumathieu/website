## Summary

Todayâ€™s building permit issuance is mainly a manual, document-based process. It therefore suffers from low accuracy, low transparency and low efficiency. This leads to delays and errors in planning, design and construction. Several attempts have been developed to push forward the digitalization of building permit procedures. But none of these have led to complete adoption of digital building permit processes within municipalities

The aim of CHEK is to take away barriers for municipalities to adopt digital building permit processes by developing, connecting and aligning scalable solutions for regulatory and policy context, for open standards and interoperability (geospatial and BIM), for closing knowledge gaps through education, for renewed municipal processes and for technology deployment

CHEK will do this by providing an innovative kit of both methodological and technical tools to digitalize building permitting and automated compliance checks on building designs and renovations in European urban areas and regions. Modularity and standardization of solutions will enable replicability in any country and context
