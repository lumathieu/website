## Mission

#### To accelerate the digital transformation of the building permit process.

## Vision

Development of **flexible, scalable and re-usable** digital and (semi-) automated building permit tools and methods in a common effort and under the umbrella of an open science framework, by sharing experiences and building-up knowledge.  



## Three Pillars

The EUnet4DBP vision is structured on three main pillars. Each of these pillars represents a field of action towards the digitalization of the building permit process. The three pillars are:

### 1) Process

Including human practices and bureaucratical workflows to be taken into account and likely changed to adopt the new digital approach. 

### 2) Rules and requirements

As formulation of criteria and guidelines to be followed for the successful achievement of the objectives in all the steps and aspects of the use case, including rule interpretation and model preparation.

### 3) Technology

Regarding any aspect related and allowing the successful implementation of the previous ones.


## Goals

### Goal 1

Support the building permit process in becoming more **efficient and automated**.

### Goal 2

Support to rule interpretation and information requirements in becoming as **simple** and as **machine readable** as possible in order to guarantee a certain level of automation.

### Goal 3

Support the wide adoption of **interoperable** technologies based on open standards.

## Principles
