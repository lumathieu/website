## Mission

#### To accelerate the digital transformation of the building permit process.

## Vision

Development of **flexible, scalable and re-usable** digital and (semi-) automated building permit tools and methods in a common effort and under the umbrella of an open science framework, by sharing experiences and building-up knowledge.  



## Three Pillars

The EUnet4DBP vision is structured on three main pillars. Each of these pillars represents a field of action towards the digitalization of the building permit process. The three pillars are:

### 1) Process

Including human practices and bureaucratical workflows to be taken into account and likely changed to adopt the new digital approach. 

### 2) Rules and requirements

As formulation of criteria and guidelines to be followed for the successful achievement of the objectives in all the steps and aspects of the use case, including rule interpretation and model preparation.

### 3) Technology

Regarding any aspect related and allowing the successful implementation of the previous ones.


## Goals

### Goal 1

Support the building permit process in becoming more **efficient and automated**.

### Goal 2

Support to rule interpretation and information requirements in becoming as **simple** and as **machine readable** as possible in order to guarantee a certain level of automation.

### Goal 3

Support the wide adoption of **interoperable** technologies based on open standards.

## The EUnet4DBP Ambitions

## The identified Requirements to reach the EUnet4DBP ambitions

r1	--	Digitalize the mindset of public officers	

r2	--	A roadmap and a change framework towards a fully digital building permit process	

r3	--	Normative text should be interpretable	

r4	--	Machine readable building codes	

r5	--	Several kinds of data can be involved in the process (GIS, BIM, etc), with related clear information requirements.

r6	--	Understanding the necessary process steps	

r7	--	Alignment across Europe and beyond in Scope and Ambition

r8	--	Standardization	

r9	--	Common Dictionaries	

r10	--	Modelling conventions and guidelines	

r11	--	Interoperability and APIs



## Principles

To be accepted and respected in order to be part of the network.

### Commitment to share

We share our knowledge, our experiences, our ideas with the other members of the network in order to turn our Vision into reality.

### Commitment to openness

We support the development of open formats, open standards and interoperable software. Our deliverables are open access resources, are published in open channels and all are freely to use them. 

### Commitment to be collaborative

We voluntarily collaborate with others to grow the network impacts on the digital transformation of the built environment.

### Commitment to be ethic

We work together in a fair environment, giving credits correctly to single participants and to the network, and keeping as confidential any un-published shared material.

### Commitment to be practical

We develop tools and methods that address the real needs of current and future users. 

### Commitment to be innovative

We believe in innovation as the only way to improve the quality of our present and future challenges. We aim at providing innovative solution of an innovative word. 

### Commitment to be competent

We lead activities that require our competences.
