### [Register here your attendance to the event](https://tudelft3d.typeform.com/to/K4jC66Tr)
Please, notice that the **MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ATTENDANTS HAS BEEN REACHED.** If you fill the form anyway, we could recontact you in case of any new place.
Otherwise, you will still be able to follow the event and interact by commenting through the **youtube streaming**. written on 23-2-21-->

-->
### (Expired) Call for contributions

#### Expired Deadline: 22nd January 2021

#### Please, **remember to indicate in the abstract** what kind of contribution you intend to submit:


  <div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/projects/eunet4dbp/img/SubmTable.png" }}" style="max-height: 500px"></div>
  
  
.

As you could notice in the table, given the great diversity of allowed contributions, an abstract will be the object of the submission, containing in addition the links to self-archived materials (papers, code, data and so on).

Papers can be presented to the conference either if already published by a journal (preferably open access) or stored within open preprint repositories (e.g. arxive.org).

The object of the submissions will be accessible to external public (hopefully participating to the event) to read and access and possibly provide review, comments and feedback.


###  “Not only Scientific” committee

Each presented work will be reviewed by people in different kinds of affiliations (to raise different kinds of questions).

Reviewers are supposed to be present to the presentation of the reviewed work and prepare questions to feed the discussion at the event.


### Publication possibilities



Publication of the abstracts in a book (e.g. EuroSDR report), in order to have space also for non-research material, which would be a substantial part here.

If a sufficient number of high-quality original papers will be presented (i.e. not yet published in a journal but only as a pre-print), we'll explore the possibility for a Journal Special Issue of selected works.

[If the Special Issue won't be realized, this wouldn't prevent the authors to publish the pre-print works elsewhere (after using the event to promote their work and get feedback).]

The idea is to avoid the dilemma:
*“Do I waste this very good work for a conference?" vs "Is it worth to go to a conference if there won’t be follow-up publications?”*

#### Recommended structure for the submission:

- Kind of contribution (A1/A2/B1/B2/C)
- Title
- Abstract (approximately 5000 characters including spaces, with pictures if needed, and a few relevant references)
- Links to relevant resources, i.e. (based on the kind of contribution presented): complete paper/s that will be presented; websites containing further information; tools; data (if necessary).
