The Chair of Computing in Engineering at the Ruhr University Bochum has been working on innovative concepts for the implementation of Building Information Modeling for many years. One focus is the development of digital approaches for the automated checking of building permits using digital building models. For this purpose, on the one hand, requirements for the digital building models have been specified so that adequate information is available for the digital checking tools. On the other hand, digital checking workflows were implemented by integrating existing standards. Currently, concepts are being developed to enable an automated transformation of building codes into standardized digital inspection rules.
