## Short description

This model represents the city of Amsterdam in CityGML, including all the entities for a seamless 3D city model (buildings, roads, vegetation, and so on).

It was produced with the software 3dfier by the TUDelft 3D geoinformation group, and slightly modified for the purposes of the benchmark.

The used Level of Detail (LoD) is 1. Check the CityGML description in the website and related documentation to have more details.

### 4 Elements

In the following images (in the software Azul), you can see the classification (and hierarchies) of specific elements, to be used as reference while performing the Task 3.
From these views you can also have a view about how the geometry looks like, in order to have a visual reference for testing your software.

<strong> Element 1 - WaterBody</strong>
<div class="row">
	<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/projects/geobim-benchmark/img/amsterdam-Fig2.gif" }}" title="Element 1)	Waterbody (in yellow)." >
</div>
------------
<strong> Element 2 - LandUse</strong>
<div class="row">
	<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/projects/geobim-benchmark/img/amsterdam-Fig3.gif" }}" title="Element 2)	LandUse (in yellow)." >
</div>
------------
<strong> Element 3 - Building</strong>

For this element it is also possible to consider the attribute 'measuredHeight' (value 11.74 m)
<div class="row">
	<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/projects/geobim-benchmark/img/amsterdam-Fig4.gif" }}" title="Element 3)	Building (in yellow)" >
</div>
------------
<strong> Element 4 - PlantCover</strong>
<div class="row">
	<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ "/projects/geobim-benchmark/img/amsterdam-Fig5.gif" }}" title="Element 4)	PlantCover (in yellow)." >
</div>
