## Short description

Procedurally generated CityGML building models (with the software <a href="http://filip.biljecki.com/code/Random3Dcity.html">Random3Dcity</a>)

Only buildings are included, and they are represented in Levels of Detail (LoD) 3, therefore including roof shapes, windows, doors. Please check the CityGML description on the linked website and related documentation to have more details on usage and licence.

The file was further checked, validated and improved through '3DcityDB' and 'Safe Software FME' Validation tools, manual editing and processing through FME tools.

**An improved and corrected version is published on 11th June 2019.** Please, download and use this new version (at the end of this page).

## Technical details

Name of the file: <strong>BuildingsLOD3.gml</strong>

Used CityGML version:<strong>2</strong>

Level(s) of Detail: <strong>LoD 3</strong> (in the same GML file)

The geometries are all managed as<strong> MultiSurfaces.</strong>


## Georeferencing details

Coordinate reference system:<strong> EPSG: 28992 â€“ Amersfoort / RD New</strong>

Bounding box coordinates:

</div>

In the following Figure, you can read some dimensions of the model, to be used for the tests in Task 3.

</div>

## Semantics details

Here, the entities included in the model are listed model (you can read the CityGML documentation for their full description):

* core:CityModel
* bldg:Buildings
* bldg:BuildingInstallation
* bldg:Door
* bldg:GroundSurface
* bldg:OuterFloorSurface
* bldg:RoofSurface
* bldg:WallSurface
* bldg.:Window


### 6 Elements

In the following images and video you can see the model (in the software Azul), with the classification (and hierarchies) of objects and <strong> attributes</strong>  of specific elements, to be used as reference while performing the Task 3.
From these views you can also have a view about how the geometry looks like, in order to have a visual reference for testing your software.
